## Overview

Ogresync is a professional Git synchronization tool designed for cross-platform use, featuring a sophisticated two-stage conflict resolution system. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

**Important**: All contributors must work exclusively on the `development` branch. The `main` branch and packaging branches are maintained by project maintainers only.

## Repository Structure & Branching Strategy

### Branch Hierarchy
- **`development`** - Active development branch where all contributions are made
- **`main`** - Stable, user-ready code for distribution (maintainer-only)
- **`windows-packaging`** - Windows executable packaging (maintainer-only)
- **`linux-packaging`** - Linux executable packaging (maintainer-only)

### Contributor Workflow
1. **Contributors** work exclusively on feature branches from `development`
2. **Maintainers** merge approved PRs from `development` → `main`
3. **Maintainers** handle packaging: `main` → platform-specific branches → releases

### Key Directories

**Main Branch (Current - User-Ready):**
- `/` - Core application modules and configuration
- `/assets/` - Application icons and branding
- **Clean, production-ready code only**

**Development Branch (Full Development Environment):**
- Contains all main branch content PLUS
- `/tests/` - Comprehensive test suite (30+ test files)
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Advanced technical documentation
- Development utilities and testing infrastructure

*Note: Contributors should work on the Development branch which contains the full test suite and development tools.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git 2.20+
- GitHub account with SSH key configured

### Development Setup
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork and switch to Development branch**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/ogresync.git
   cd ogresync
   git checkout Development  # IMPORTANT: Development branch has tests and dev tools
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install pytest flake8 black
   ```
4. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:AbijithBalaji/ogresync.git
   ```
5. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   # Test the application
   python Ogresync.py --help
   
   # Run tests to ensure everything works
   python tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py
   ```

### Verify Installation
```bash
python Ogresync.py --help
```
You should see the application help menu.

## Development Process

### Creating a Feature Branch
Always branch from the latest `Development` branch (not main):
```bash
git checkout Development
git pull upstream Development
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Features**: `feature/add-batch-processing`
- **Bug fixes**: `fix/conflict-resolution-memory-leak`
- **Documentation**: `docs/update-setup-guide`
- **Tests**: `test/improve-offline-coverage`

### Making Changes
1. **Keep changes focused** - One feature/fix per branch
2. **Write tests** for new functionality
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Follow code standards** (see below)

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add batch processing for multiple repository sync"
git commit -m "Fix memory leak in conflict resolution stage 2"

# Avoid
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

## Testing

Ogresync has a comprehensive test suite with 30+ test files covering various scenarios. **Tests are located in the `Development` branch only.**

### Running Tests
First, switch to the development branch to access the test suite:
```bash
git checkout Development
```

Then run tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run the comprehensive test suite
python tests/comprehensive_test_suite.py

# Run specific test categories
python tests/test_conflict_resolution.py
python tests/test_offline_components.py
python tests/test_security_fixes.py
```

### Key Test Areas
- **Conflict Resolution**: Two-stage merge and resolution system
- **Offline Functionality**: Repository sync without network access
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Windows, Linux, macOS support
- **Security**: Command injection prevention and input validation
- **Edge Cases**: Complex merge scenarios and error handling

### Writing Tests
When adding new features:
1. **Add unit tests** for individual functions
2. **Add integration tests** for feature workflows
3. **Test cross-platform compatibility** where applicable
4. **Include edge cases** and error conditions

Example test structure:
```python
def test_new_feature():
    """Test description explaining the scenario."""
    # Setup
    test_data = setup_test_repository()
    
    # Execute
    result = your_new_function(test_data)
    
    # Verify
    assert result.success == True
    assert result.conflicts_resolved == expected_count
```

## Code Standards

### Python Standards
- **PEP 8 compliance** - Use `flake8` or `black` for formatting
- **Type hints** where appropriate
- **Docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- **Error handling** with specific exception types

### Code Organization
- **Modular design** - Keep functions focused and reusable
- **Clear variable names** - Avoid abbreviations
- **Comments** for complex logic, especially in conflict resolution
- **Constants** in UPPER_CASE

### Example Code Style
```python
def resolve_merge_conflicts(repository_path: str, strategy: str = "smart") -> ConflictResolution:
    """
    Resolve merge conflicts using the specified strategy.
    
    Args:
        repository_path: Absolute path to the Git repository
        strategy: Conflict resolution strategy ('smart', 'manual', 'auto')
    
    Returns:
        ConflictResolution object with resolution status and details
    
    Raises:
        RepositoryError: If repository path is invalid
        ConflictResolutionError: If conflicts cannot be resolved
    """
    if not os.path.exists(repository_path):
        raise RepositoryError(f"Repository not found: {repository_path}")
    
    # Implementation here...
    return ConflictResolution(success=True, method=strategy)
```

### UI and User Experience
- **Consistent terminology** across all interfaces
- **Clear error messages** with actionable guidance
- **Cross-platform compatibility** considerations
- **Professional appearance** in GUI elements

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git checkout Development
   git pull upstream Development
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase Development
   ```
2. **Run the full test suite**:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```
3. **Ensure code quality**:
   ```bash
   flake8 *.py
   ```
