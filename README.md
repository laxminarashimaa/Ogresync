# Ogresync

![Ogresync Logo](assets/logo.ico)


**Ogresync** is an open-source synchronization tool that automates syncing your Obsidian vault with GitHub using Git and SSH. Built using Python, it’s a project by **Ogrelix**, a startup focused on creating streamlined, user-centric software tools that simplify digital workflows.

---

## Features

- **One-Time Setup Wizard**  
  Automatically detects Obsidian, configures Git and SSH, and guides you through selecting your vault and linking your GitHub repository.

- **Automatic Synchronization**  
  Detects local changes, pulls remote updates with stash support, launches Obsidian, and upon closing, commits and pushes updates automatically.

- **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**  
  Handles merge conflicts with options to keep local or remote changes, or resolve manually. (Currently under refinement—see Known Issues.)

- **Offline Resilience**  
  Works even without an internet connection, queues local commits, and pushes them automatically when online.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
  Supports Windows, Linux (AppImage), and macOS (.app). Platform-specific behaviors are handled internally.

- **Community-Centric & Open Source**  
  Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome to enhance and expand the project further.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Git:** Ensure Git is installed and available in your system PATH.  
  [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

- **SSH:** A valid SSH key is required for GitHub synchronization. If absent, Ogresync will assist you in generating one and provide manual instructions if needed.

- **Obsidian:** Install from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

## Usage
### 1\. Initial Setup

-   The wizard helps you choose your Obsidian vault and configures everything, including SSH and GitHub repository setup.

-   If you don't have a GitHub repo, you'll be prompted to create a private one and provide its URL.

-   SSH keys are auto-generated if not found. On Linux/macOS, manual instructions are displayed in case clipboard copy fails.

### 2\. Automatic Synchronization

Once setup is complete, just run **Ogresync** instead of opening Obsidian directly.

-   It pulls any updates from GitHub before opening Obsidian.

-   You edit your notes as usual in Obsidian.

-   After you close Obsidian:

    -   Any changes are automatically committed.

    -   If online, changes are pushed to GitHub.

    -   If offline, they remain committed locally and will be pushed later.

### 3\. Conflict Handling

If the same file is modified on two systems:

-   Conflicts are detected and logged.

-   You will be prompted to resolve using:

    -   Keep Local Changes

    -   Use Remote Changes

    -   Merge Manually

(See Known Issues for current limitations.)

## Known Issues

- **Conflict Dialog Not Triggering Properly:**
The dialog for resolving merge conflicts is not always shown as expected during certain workflows. We are actively working to fix this.

- **Linux and macOS Bugs:**
While basic functionality works, further testing and optimizations are needed. Clipboard features may not work out of the box.

- **Packaging & Shortcuts:**
Native shortcut creation (Start Menu, desktop icons, app directory registration) is not yet implemented.

- **Setup Responsiveness:**
If the user exits dialog boxes prematurely during setup, the main window may become unresponsive. A fallback loop is under development.

---

## Roadmap
- **Enhanced Conflict Resolution UI:**
  Improve the merge conflict dialog and integrate external merge tools.

- **Native Shortcuts & Installers:**
  Develop desktop/start menu shortcuts and native installers for all platforms.

- **Cross-Platform Packaging:**
  Further refine packaging for macOS (.app) and Linux (AppImage) to ensure a seamless user experience.

- **Additional Features:**
  Custom commit messages, scheduled syncs, and more.
