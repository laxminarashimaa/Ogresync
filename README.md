### Required Software

**1. Obsidian**
- Download from: [https://obsidian.md/download](https://obsidian.md/download)
- Install and run Obsidian
- Create a vault folder where you want to store your notes

**2. Git**
- Download from: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- For new users: Run the setup file and click "Next" until you reach "Setup Completed" for standard Git installation
- Git is required for repository synchronization

## Download & Installation

### Available Platforms

| Platform | Download | Status |

## How Ogresync Works

Ogresync fundamentally changes how you interact with Obsidian by becoming the central orchestrator for all your note-taking activities. Instead of opening Obsidian directly, you launch Ogresync, which then handles the entire synchronization workflow seamlessly.

### Core Workflow Overview

**This is the heart of Ogresync - understanding this workflow is crucial:**

1. **Launch Ogresync** (not Obsidian) - This is your new workflow
2. **Ogresync performs intelligent pre-sync** - Checks for remote changes, handles conflicts
3. **Ogresync launches Obsidian automatically** - With your vault already synchronized
4. **Edit your notes freely** - Work normally in Obsidian without sync worries
5. **Close Obsidian when finished** - Ogresync detects closure immediately
6. **Ogresync handles post-sync** - Commits your changes, pushes to GitHub, handles any new conflicts

This workflow ensures your vault is always in perfect sync before and after editing, with intelligent conflict resolution at every step.

### Why This Workflow Matters

**Traditional Approach Problems:**
- Opening Obsidian directly can lead to sync conflicts
- Manual git operations are error-prone
- No visibility into sync status during editing
- Conflicts discovered only after making changes

**Ogresync's Solution:**
- **Pre-sync verification** ensures clean starting state
- **Active monitoring** tracks changes during editing
- **Automatic conflict detection** before they become problems
- **Intelligent post-processing** handles any edge cases

**The result:** A worry-free editing experience where synchronization happens invisibly and reliably.

### First-Time Setup

On first launch, Ogresync runs in **Setup Mode** with an 11-step wizard that guides you through:

1. **Obsidian Checkup** - Verify Obsidian installation
2. **Git Check** - Verify Git installation  
3. **Choose Vault** - Select your Obsidian vault folder
4. **Initialize Git** - Setup Git repository in your vault
5. **SSH Key Setup** - Generate or verify SSH key for GitHub
6. **Known Hosts** - Add GitHub to trusted hosts
7. **Test SSH** - Test SSH connection to GitHub
8. **GitHub Repository** - Link your GitHub repository
9. **Repository Sync** - Enhanced two-stage conflict resolution
10. **Final Sync** - Intelligent synchronization with safeguards
11. **Complete Setup** - Finalize configuration

Once setup is complete, a configuration file is stored in OS-specific locations:
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Ogresync\`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/ogresync/`

To run setup again, delete the configuration file and restart the application.

**After Setup - Sync Mode:**
Once setup is complete, Ogresync switches to **Sync Mode** which follows the core workflow described above. Every time you want to use Obsidian, simply launch Ogresync instead.

## Setup Wizard Guide

The 11-step setup wizard is designed to be user-friendly even without Git knowledge:

### Phase 1: Environment Verification (Steps 1-2)
- **Obsidian Detection:** Automatically finds your Obsidian installation
- **Git Verification:** Ensures Git is properly installed and configured

### Phase 2: Repository Initialization (Steps 3-4)
- **Vault Selection:** Choose your existing vault or create a new one
- **Git Setup:** Initialize repository in your vault and create initial commit

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration (Steps 5-7)
- **SSH Key Generation:** Creates secure SSH keys for GitHub authentication
- **GitHub Setup:** Configures secure connection to GitHub servers
- **Connection Testing:** Verifies everything works properly before proceeding

### Phase 4: Repository Synchronization (Steps 8-11)
- **Repository Linking:** Connects your local vault to GitHub repository
- **Enhanced Conflict Resolution:** Uses two-stage system if both local and remote have content
- **Final Sync:** Completes setup with intelligent synchronization
- **Configuration:** Saves all settings for future sync sessions

**What happens during Repository Sync (Step 9):**

The wizard analyzes your repository state and handles four scenarios:

1. **Both Empty:** Creates initial README and prepares for first sync
2. **Local Empty, Remote Has Files:** Simple pull operation to get remote content
3. **Local Has Files, Remote Empty:** Prepares local files for push to GitHub
4. **Both Have Files:** **Triggers enhanced two-stage conflict resolution**

When both repositories contain files, Ogresync automatically detects conflicts and launches the two-stage resolution system, ensuring safe merging of your content with complete history preservation.

Each step provides clear guidance and error recovery options.

## Purpose

This project was born out of necessity and passion for both Obsidian and open-source solutions. As a developer who couldn't afford the $9 monthly subscription for Obsidian Sync, I started by creating a simple git-based synchronization script for my personal use case.

What began as a mini-scale solution for syncing my notes between devices quickly evolved into something much larger. As I encountered various edge cases, network interruptions, and collaboration scenarios, I found myself building increasingly sophisticated git logic to handle these challenges.

Today, Ogresync represents months of development, testing, and refinement. It handles complex git operations, provides intelligent conflict resolution, supports offline workflows, and offers the kind of reliability you'd expect from commercial software - all while remaining free and open source.

The goal was simple: make Obsidian synchronization accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget or technical expertise, while providing even more advanced features than traditional sync solutions.
